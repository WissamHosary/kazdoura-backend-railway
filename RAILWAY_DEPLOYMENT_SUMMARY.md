## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Railway Database Credentials
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project from your GitHub repo
3. Add MySQL database service
4. Copy database credentials from Railway dashboard

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Railway
Add these to your Railway backend service:

```env
# Database (Replace with your Railway MySQL credentials)
DB_HOST=your-railway-mysql-host
DB_USER=your-railway-mysql-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-railway-mysql-password
DB_NAME=your-railway-mysql-database
DB_PORT=3306

# JWT (Change this secret!)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this
JWT_EXPIRE=30d

# Admin Credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@kazdoura.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Awsedrft123

# Server
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=production

# CORS
CORS_ORIGIN=https://admin.kazdoura-lb.com

# Upload
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
UPLOAD_PATH=./public/uploads
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway
1. Run the deployment script: `deploy-railway.bat`
2. Or manually push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to Railway"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 4: Update Dashboard API URL
After Railway deploys, get your backend URL and update:
- File: `dashboard/src/services/api.js`
- Change: `https://kazdoura-backend-railway-production.up.railway.app/api`
- To: `https://your-actual-railway-url.up.railway.app/api`

### Step 5: Test Connection
1. Test health endpoint: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/health`
2. Test admin login at: https://admin.kazdoura-lb.com/
   - Email: `admin@kazdoura.com`
   - Password: `Awsedrft123`

## 🔍 Where to Find Railway Database Credentials

### In Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click on MySQL database service
3. Go to "Connect" tab
4. Copy these values:
   - **Host**: `mysql.railway.app` (or specific host)
   - **User**: Your database username
   - **Password**: Your database password
   - **Database**: Your database name
   - **Port**: `3306`

### Example Railway Database URL:
```
mysql://user:password@host:port/database
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard Can't Connect:
1. Check Railway backend URL is correct
2. Verify CORS settings include your dashboard domain
3. Check Railway logs for errors

### If Database Connection Fails:
1. Verify all database environment variables are set
2. Check Railway MySQL service is running
3. Ensure database credentials are correct

### If Authentication Fails:
1. Verify JWT_SECRET is set
2. Check admin credentials in environment variables
3. Clear browser localStorage and try again
